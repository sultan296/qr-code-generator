# qr-code-generator

I showcase a QR code generator website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a simple interface where users can enter text or a URL, and with the click of a button, a corresponding QR code is generated. The design is clean and user-friendly, allowing for an engaging experience. You can easily scan the generated QR codes using your mobile device to access the specified links or view the entered text.
